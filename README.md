## 📌 What is SmartQueue AI?

SmartQueue AI is an intelligent virtual queue management system that replaces physical waiting lines with digital tokens. Using AI to predict accurate wait times, it reduces overcrowding and improves service efficiency in hospitals and banks.

**Simply put:** No more standing in line. Get a virtual token, wait anywhere, and know exactly when it's your turn.
