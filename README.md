🚀 SmartQueue AI
AI-Powered Multi-Domain Queue Management System
📌 Project Overview

SmartQueue AI is a web-based intelligent queue management system designed to replace traditional physical queues with virtual token-based queues. It leverages AI-driven waiting time prediction to provide real-time insights, reduce overcrowding, and improve service efficiency.

The system supports priority handling for senior citizens, emergency cases, and special categories and is adaptable across multiple domains such as hospitals, banks, government offices, and colleges.

🎯 Problem Statement

Traditional queue systems suffer from:

Long and unpredictable waiting times

Physical overcrowding

Lack of priority handling

Poor user experience

Inefficient resource utilization

SmartQueue AI addresses these challenges by introducing a digital, intelligent, and scalable queue system.

💡 Solution

SmartQueue AI provides:

Virtual token generation instead of physical lines

AI-based waiting time prediction

Real-time queue status updates

Priority-based queue management

Admin control and analytics

🧩 Key Features
🔹 Common Features (All Domains)

✅ Virtual Token Generation

✅ AI-Based Waiting Time Prediction

✅ Real-Time Queue Tracking

✅ Priority Handling (Senior Citizens, Emergencies)

✅ Token Expiry Rules

✅ Admin Dashboard & Analytics

🏥 Domain-Specific Features

Hospital
Emergency queue override
Doctor-wise queue management
Appointment + walk-in support

Bank
Service-based queues (cash, loan, account)
Counter load balancing
Government Office
Document-based queue segregation

AI model predicts estimated waiting time

Queue is dynamically updated in real time

Priority users are automatically reordered

Admin monitors and manages queues via dashboard

User receives live queue status updates

🧠 AI Waiting Time Prediction Logic

Waiting time is calculated using:

Current queue length

Average service time

Historical service data

Active counters

This ensures more accurate and dynamic predictions compared to static queue systems.
